🍷🔬 Wine Quality and Forecast 🍾🍇

In my study, I analyzed the quality of red and white wines and visualized the results 🧪📈

Red Wine Quality Average: 5.64
White Wine Quality Average: 5.88

According to my analysis, the factors that most influence wine quality:
Red Wine:
-Alcohol content
-Sulphate rate
-Volatile acidity

White Wine
-Alcohol content
-Density ratio
-Volatile acidity

🔍 When white wine quality is estimated with the values of a red wine with a quality of 6, the result is a white wine quality of 4. However, when predicted with the values of a red wine with a quality of 8, we see that the white wine quality increases to 9.
